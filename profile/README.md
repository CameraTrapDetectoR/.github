## :wolf: Welcome to the CameraTrapDetector Project :wolf:



**The CameraTrapDetector project is a customized object detection deep learning model that identifies, classifies, and counts animals in camera trap images.** 
**The model can be run on personal computer as part of an existing workflow, saving time and preserving data privacy.**
